CS219-Project1
Name: Tania Jaswal
Project part 1 For Cs219 Computer Organization

In this project, we are designing a machine language simulator which will implement the ADD operation.

For this project, I am using Linux. It is the Ubuntu virtual box. The makefile allows us to compile using the **make** command in the terminal. This will compile the **main.cpp** file.
